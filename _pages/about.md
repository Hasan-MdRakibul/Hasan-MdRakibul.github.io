## The Journey of an Aspiring Ph.D. Candidate
In the quest for wisdom, Aristotle's timeless words, "Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom," have deeply resonated with me. Reflecting on my undergraduate years, I must confess that this quote held little significance back then. I grappled with uncertainty about my life's direction and my vision for the future. However, as time passed, I embarked on a transformative journey of self-discovery that has brought me to this defining moment: seeking a **Ph.D. position in Computer Science**.

My academic journey began at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I pursued both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Management Information Systems (MIS). These formative years laid the groundwork for my expertise in data science. While pursuing my degrees, I had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished professors in various consultancy projects as a data analyst, honing my skills and passion for data science.

Following my exceptional academic performance, I embraced my role as a faculty member at the Department of Management Information Systems (MIS), University of Dhaka. It was during my tenure as an academician that I keenly observed the rapid advancements in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and AI. This realization sparked my eagerness to pursue higher education in computer science and deepen my understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.

With this newfound vision, I currently find myself pursuing my second master's degree in computer science at Morgan State University, USA, with an expected completion date before fall 2024. My ongoing graduate program is thoughtfully curated, focusing on deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision, bridging the gap between my current expertise and my aspirations of becoming a Ph.D. scholar. Furthermore, my research initiatives align harmoniously with my future Ph.D. pursuits, promising meaningful contributions to the field.

My research interests converge around the fascinating world of artificial intelligence applied to medical image processing. In particular, I am deeply passionate about leveraging deep learning techniques for automated caption generation and multi-labelling in the domain of medical imaging. To tackle the opacity of AI models in medical image processing tasks, I am harnessing the power of explainable AI tools, shedding light on the inner workings of these "black box" systems. My thesis, aptly titled "Explainable AI in Interpreting CNN and Transformer-based Automated Medical Image Captioning and Multi-labeling Systems," aims to enhance the understanding and interpretability of AI-driven medical image analysis, elevating patient care and medical decision-making processes.

As a testament to my dedication to the field, I led a team in the prestigious ImageCLEF Medical 2023 competition, organized by the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). This platform allowed us to showcase our prowess in medical image captioning and concept detection tasks. My research findings were presented at the ImageCLEF 2023 conference, in a workshop note titled "Concept Detection and Caption Prediction in ImageCLEFmedical Caption 2023 with Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision, and Text-to-Text Transfer Transformers." Additionally, esteemed conferences such as IEEE SMC 2023, SPIE Medical Imaging 2024, and ABRCMS 2023 have graciously accepted my works for publication, further disseminating knowledge and advancements in medical image processing and AI. I am also actively contributing as a research assistant for a prestigious NSF-funded project titled "Deep Learning-Based Automated Concept and Caption Generation of Medical Images Towards Developing an Effective Decision Support System." This endeavor represents a thrilling opportunity to apply cutting-edge AI techniques and contribute to the development of more effective medical decision support systems.

Beyond my academic achievements and research endeavors, I have been privileged to contribute to various consultancy projects for respected private and public institutions in Bangladesh. As a team leader for software development and automation projects and as a data scientist in survey-based scientific endeavors, I have consistently delivered effective solutions and valuable insights derived from diverse datasets. My collaborations with esteemed institutions, including the ICT Division of Bangladesh, the Ministry of Science and Technology of Bangladesh, and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, have positively impacted various sectors and fostered the country's development.

In conclusion, my journey of self-discovery and academic pursuit has fortified my commitment to advancing computer science and making meaningful contributions through research. Guided by Aristotle's wisdom, I am eager to continue my pursuit of knowledge and self-awareness through a Ph.D., seeking to advance the state-of-the-art in computer vision and introducing novel algorithms and methodologies.

**Thank you for taking the time to read my story.**
