## The Journey of an Aspiring Ph.D. Applicant

My academic journey began at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I pursued both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Management Information Systems (MIS). While pursuing my degrees, I had the privilege of working with my professors in various consultancy projects as a data analyst. The curricula and project works throughout these years laid the foundation of my interest in computer and information science. Following my impressive academic performance, I got the opportunity to serve as a faculty member at the Department of Management Information Systems (MIS), University of Dhaka. During my tenure as an academician, I keenly observed the rapid advancements in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and AI. This realization also sparked my eagerness to pursue higher education. With this vision, I have recently completed my second master's degree in computer science at Morgan State University, USA. This graduate program was thoughtfully designed by emphasizing on deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. As a result, this degree is bridging the gap between my current expertise and my aspirations of becoming a Ph.D. applicant in computer sceince or information systems. Furthermore, my research initiatives align harmoniously with my future Ph.D. pursuits.

My research interests include the application of AI in medical image analysis and heallth informatics. Moreover, I am working on leveraging multi-modal vision-language models in analyzing radiology images, reports, and other forms data (i.e., signal, temporal, demographic, etc.). Along with these, I have interest in doing research on explainability and unbiasedness of Transformer-based architectures used in medical domain. 

In a recent work of mine presented ImageCLEFmedical Caption 2024 challenge and published in CEUR Workshop Proceedings as the first runner-up, I explored the potential of Vision-Language Model (VLM) in multi-modal radiology image analysis and automated caption generation. I experiemnted with fine-tuning and Low-rank Optimization (LoRA) techniques on Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) v.1.6 and Mistral-7B VLMs, and compared the results with other pre-trained Transformer-based architecture (e.g., VisionGPT2). Furthermore, I am trying to push forward this experiment in order to achieve more accuracy in processing multi-modal images and widen the scope such as breast mammogram image classification using different standard datasets (i.e., EMBED, VinDr-Mammo, RSNA-Mammo, MIAS, CBIS-DDSM, InBreast) by addressing minimum racial disparity and maximum interpretability. Along with this, I am collaborating in other projects of health informatics, which involve the analysis hospital discharge summary reports and data from patients' wearable devices.

In recognition to my recent publications and master's thesis, I was awarded with the IBM Masters Fellowship 2023 award. Moreover, I was also awarded with the Trailblazer Award two times for excellent academic achievement from the School of Graduate Studies, Morgan State University, USA.

I have also contributed as a research assistant for a NSF-funded project titled "Deep Learning-Based Automated Concept and Caption Generation of Medical Images Towards Developing an Effective Decision Support System." At the same time, I had the experience of working as a teaching assistant for the courses like machine learning, AI, image processing.

Beyond my academic achievements and research endeavors, I have contributed to various consultancy projects of private and public institutions in Bangladesh. As a team leader of a software development project or as a data analyst in other consultancy projects, I have consistently delivered effective solutions and valuable insights. My collaborations with institutions like the ICT Division of Bangladesh, the Ministry of Science and Technology of Bangladesh, and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, have positively impacted various sectors' incremental development.

In conclusion, my academic journey has strengthened my commitment to pursue a Ph.D. to deepen my knowledge and make meaningful advancements in computer science or information systems.

**Thank you for your patience.**
